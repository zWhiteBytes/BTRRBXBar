# BTRRBXHud (probably windows-only)

this is a pure, simple, python script to replace all of the topbar ui 
assets with images in the assets/ folder, being the standard option
to simply make transparent most of the useful ones.

# how do i use it?

download the code, extract it and just run the python script.
that should do the trick, also dont get scared if it runs and closes,
unless no text pops up or whatever idk man

# well how do i open the menu now?

1. click the invisible button
2. press 'esc'
