# BTRRBXBar (formerly BTRRBXHud) (windows-only)

btrrbxbar is a python script to replace roblox topbar assets
HOWEVER, the asset change is NOT permanent. you will have to re-run it each time roblox updates.

# Well, how do I run it?

have python, download the code, unzip it and just run the python script.

# But how do I open the menu now? (invisible-preset)

you have two choices:

1. click the now-invisible button
2. simply press 'esc'

# How do I make a custom preset?

all you need to do is get the "Original" preset, unzip it and you'll see the png's you need to edit. 
as long as you edit it and dont mess with the resolution, you're good to go.

me personally i'd use paint.net, but you can use whatever
also an reminder, you have to edit size variants (if @2x or @3x exists for that file)

# why the hell do you update this 500 times?

i have no idea.
