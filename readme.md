# BTRRBXHud (probably windows-only)

this is a pure, simple, python script to replace all of the topbar ui 
assets with images in the assets/ folder, being the standard option
to simply make transparent most of the useful ones.

# how do i use it?

download the code, extract it and just run the python script.
that should do the trick
