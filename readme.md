# BTRRBXHud (windows-only)

this is a python script to replace roblox topbar assets,
nothing else really.

# Well, how do I run it?

have python, download the code, extract the zip and just run the python script.

# But how do I open the menu now? (invisible-preset)

you have two choices:

1. click the now-invisible button
2. simply press 'esc'

# How do I make a custom preset?

all you need to do is get the "Original" preset, unzip it and you'll see the png's you need to edit. 
as long as you edit it and dont mess with the resolution, you're good to go.

me personally i'd use paint.net, but you can use whatever
also an reminder, you have to edit size variants (if @2x or @3x exists for that file)
