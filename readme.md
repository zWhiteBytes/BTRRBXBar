# BTRRBXHud (probably windows-only)

this is a pure and simple, python script to replace all of the roblox topbar ui 
assets with the files in the assets/ folder, being the standard option
to make all important ones transparent.

you can also replace the png files to customize them, and then
just run the script!

# Well, how do I run it?

have python, download the code, extract the zip and just run the python script.
that should do the trick. if it runs and closes, thats how fast it is.
unless an error appears...

# But how do I open the menu now?

you have two choices:

1. click the now-invisible button
2. simply press 'esc'

those should work
